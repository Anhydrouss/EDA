# EDA & Pearson correlation coefficient
The most useful output was the correlation between variables. The highest correlation with bad debt was previous delinquency alerts at 89%, indicating that past payment behavior was a strong predictor of future payment behavior. Delinquency alerts and bad debt had a p-value of 0.0, which was statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. This suggests that there was a less than 5% chance that the observed correlation occurred by chance, and was generally considered to be a strong indication of a true relationship between the two variables. The second highest correlation with bad debt was account status at 78%, but this was likely due to the business process that debt was only written off after the account was inactive/closed and therefore does not have any meaningful relationship outside of a procedural norm.

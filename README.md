# EDA & Pearson correlation coefficient
The most useful output is the correlation between variables. The highest correlation with bad debt was previous delinquency alerts at 89%, indicating that past payment behavior is a strong predictor of future payment behavior. Delinquency alerts and bad debt had a p-value of 0.0, which is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. This suggests that there is a less than 5% chance that the observed correlation occurred by chance, and is generally considered to be a strong indication of a true relationship between the two variables. The second highest correlation with bad debt was account status at 78%, but this is likely due to the fact that debt is only written off after the account is closed and therefore does not have any significance.
